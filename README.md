![Archive at a glance, four tiles: 109 project folders, 100 in language folders and 9 in topic folders; 11 language folders, 4 tiers each, easy to expert; 1,011 project files, 142 of them READMEs; 92 portfolio entries, 13 chips, 84 pointing back into this repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudhanshu1402/engineering-projects/main/assets/glance.svg)

A personal learning archive of coding projects, sorted by language and difficulty tier. It's practice code: many builds are small or unfinished, and each tier README says what's there. Also carries a
single-page portfolio site (`index.html`) deployed to GitHub Pages.

## What is in here

![Inventory: 100 projects in 11 language folders, python 16, cpp 10, c and csharp 9, the rest 8 each; topic folders machine-learning-basics 4, android 2, dbms 2, machine-learning 1; commonest files .cpp 77, .py 47, .java 37](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudhanshu1402/engineering-projects/main/assets/inventory.svg)

Each language folder splits into `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `expert`, with its own per-tier README.

## Runnable checks

```bash
node scripts/make-readme-svg.mjs   # redraw both images above
node scripts/check-vault.mjs       # portfolio page still matches projects_data.js
```

The images are counted from `git ls-files` and `projects_data.js`. The generator throws rather
than draw a blank frame, and CI fails on drift.
